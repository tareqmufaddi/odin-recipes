    <h3>The best Mansaf recipe.</h3>
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Lamb</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Jameed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slow cook meat</li>
        <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
        <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar</li>
        <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich – see video for consistency (Note 6). Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required</li>
    </ol>
